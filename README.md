As long as you can read this statement, the content in this repository is work in 
progress and and will be updated or changed on a regular basis.

Please find the respective documentation in the documentation folder.

Within the quickStart folder, the getToolboxes.sh function will download most of 
the required toolboxes for you (please double check with the documentation). 
makenewsubeject.sh will create a folder structure for a new subject (works only
if the template_session folder is present). So a good way would be to treat 
quickStart as main analysis folder.

All scripts are located in quickStart/template_session/template_scripts and 
required additional helper files in quickStart/template_session/template_helperfiles
